# Description

This is the repo I used to improve my FastAPI python skill

# What have I learnt
- **`CRUD`**: Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT), Update (Patch), Delete (DELETE).

```diff
+ Update (PUT): Update the entire resource

+ Update (Patch): Update part of the resource
```
- **`CONT`**: CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE

```diff
+ CONNECT: Creates a tunnel to the server, based on the target resource

+ OPTIONS: Describes communication options to the target

+ TRACE: Performs a message loop-back to the target
```

- **`STATUS CODE`**: 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx

```diff
+ 1xx - Information Response: Request processing

+ 2xx - Success: Request successfully complete

+ 3xx - Redirection: Further action must be complete

+ 4xx - Client Errors: An error was caused by the request from the client

+ 5xx - Server Errors: An error has occurred on the server
```
